    "In this assignment, you have to implement the LinkedList class introduced in Chapter 18 and all of its fields and methods (see slide \\#15 for the list of fields and methods that must be implemented and tested). Furthermore, implement a printList method that prints elements of a LinkedList object as a string. You will use this method for testing your other LinkedList methods. For each operation handle possible exceptions (if there is any) and provide at least 3 test cases. Choose your test cases appropriately such that they cover all boundary cases and also exceptions. For each test case, use the printList method to print your LinkedList object after each calling each operation. Also use the print command to print an appropriate message whenever as exception is raised."
